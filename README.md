# My very first HTML website!

> I applied HTML and CSS styling techniques to design a website that highlights some of my skills and educational background. This website was created as a lab assignment for the [Introduction to Cloud Computing](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer) course offered by IBM (which is course 1 of the IBM Full Stack Developer Professional Certification Program).
